# Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models for Humanoid Robotics - Implementation Tasks

## Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models

### Task 1: Vision Processing Module Implementation
- [ ] Set up computer vision pipeline
- [ ] Integrate object detection model
- [ ] Implement spatial reasoning component
- [ ] Connect to robot camera feed
- [ ] Test vision processing with sample images

### Task 2: Language Processing Module Implementation
- [ ] Select appropriate transformer model
- [ ] Implement natural language understanding pipeline
- [ ] Create language-to-action mapping

- [ ] Test with various command types

### Task 3: Action Generation Module Implementation
- [ ] Map commands to robot action primitives
- [ ] Integrate with ROS2 control system
- [ ] Implement safety validation layer
- [ ] Create action execution interface
- [ ] Test individual action primitives

### Task 4: System Integration
- [ ] Create unified VLA interface
- [ ] Implement real-time processing pipeline
- [ ] Add error handling and fallbacks
- [ ] Conduct integration testing
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Task 5: Validation and Testing
