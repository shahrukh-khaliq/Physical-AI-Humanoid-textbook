# Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on creating digital twins for humanoid robots using physics-based simulation and rendering. This module covers advanced techniques for building realistic simulation environments using Gazebo for physics and Unity for high-fidelity visualization.

## Overview

This module is designed for AI practitioners and robotics engineers with basic ROS knowledge. You'll learn to leverage both Gazebo and Unity to create comprehensive digital twin solutions for humanoid robots.

## Chapters

1. [Physics Simulation with Gazebo](./chapter-1-gazebo-physics-simulation.md) - Simulating gravity, collisions, and dynamics for humanoid robots
2. [High-Fidelity Environments with Unity](./chapter-2-unity-digital-twins.md) - Visual realism and human-robot interaction
3. [Sensor Simulation](./chapter-3-sensor-simulation.md) - LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs, and noise modeling

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand how to create realistic physics simulations using Gazebo for humanoid robots
