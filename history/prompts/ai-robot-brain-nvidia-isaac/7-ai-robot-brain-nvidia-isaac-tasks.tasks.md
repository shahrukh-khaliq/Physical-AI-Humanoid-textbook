## Summary of Changes

This task list defines the implementation approach for Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics project, focusing on the AI-Robot Brain using NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem. The tasks are organized into 6 phases with 42 individual tasks.

## Task Breakdown

- **Phase 1**: Setup (3 tasks) - Project initialization
- **Phase 2**: Foundational (5 tasks) - Blocking prerequisites
- **Phase 3**: User Story 1 - Isaac Sim for Perception Training (8 tasks) - Priority P1
- **Phase 4**: User Story 2 - Isaac ROS for Real-Time Perception (8 tasks) - Priority P2
- **Phase 5**: User Story 3 - Nav2 for Humanoid Navigation (9 tasks) - Priority P3
- **Phase 6**: Polish & Cross-Cutting (7 tasks)

## Key Features

- Tasks follow proper format with checkboxes, IDs, and story labels
- Parallel execution opportunities marked with [P] flag
- Dependencies clearly defined between phases
- User stories organized by priority (P1, P2, P3)
- Implementation strategy includes MVP-first approach

## Next Steps

The task list is ready for the implementation phase (/sp.implement).
