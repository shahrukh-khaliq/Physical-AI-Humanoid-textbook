## Summary of Changes

This specification defines Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics project, focusing on the AI-Robot Brain using NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem. The specification covers Isaac Sim for perception training, Isaac ROS for real-time perception, and Nav2 for humanoid navigation.

## Key Components

- User Story 1: NVIDIA Isaac Sim for Perception Training (P1 priority)
- User Story 2: Isaac ROS for Real-Time Perception (P2 priority)
- User Story 3: Nav2 for Humanoid Navigation (P3 priority)

## Requirements Overview

The specification includes 12 functional requirements covering simulation, perception, navigation, and integration aspects. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic.

## Next Steps

The specification is complete and ready for the planning phase (/sp.plan).
