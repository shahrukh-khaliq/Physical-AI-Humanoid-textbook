# Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Integration

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) integration for humanoid robotics. This module covers the integration of language models, perception, and robotic action to create intelligent systems that can understand voice commands, plan complex tasks, and execute them in the physical world.

## Overview

This module is designed for AI practitioners and robotics engineers with ROS 2 knowledge. You'll learn to build systems that can process voice commands using OpenAI Whisper, decompose natural language into executable actions using Large Language Models, and execute these actions on humanoid robots.

## Chapters

1. [Voice-to-Action](./chapter-1-voice-to-action.md) - Speech recognition and voice command processing using OpenAI Whisper
2. [Cognitive Planning with LLMs](./chapter-2-cognitive-planning.md) - Natural language understanding and task decomposition using LLMs
3. [Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid](./chapter-3-vla-capstone.md) - Complete VLA pipeline integration with navigation, perception, and manipulation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand how to implement voice-driven robot control systems using OpenAI Whisper
- Learn to use Large Language Models for natural language understanding and task decomposition
- Integrate all components into a complete Vision-Language-Action pipeline
- Build autonomous humanoid systems that can perceive, understand, and act based on voice commands
