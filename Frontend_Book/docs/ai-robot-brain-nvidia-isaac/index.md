# AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on creating an AI-Robot Brain using the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem. This module covers advanced perception, navigation, and training techniques for humanoid robots using NVIDIA's powerful simulation and perception tools.

## Overview

This module is designed for AI practitioners and robotics engineers familiar with ROS 2 and simulation. You'll learn to leverage NVIDIA Isaac technologies to build sophisticated robot perception and navigation systems.

## Chapters

1. [NVIDIA Isaac Sim](./chapter-1-isaac-sim.md) - Photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation for perception training
2. [Isaac ROS](./chapter-2-isaac-ros.md) - Hardware-accelerated VSLAM and perception pipelines
3. [Nav2 for Humanoid Navigation](./chapter-3-nav2-humanoid-navigation.md) - Path planning concepts for bipedal robots

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand how to use NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- Implement hardware-accelerated perception pipelines using Isaac ROS
- Configure Nav2 for humanoid robot navigation with specialized path planning
- Integrate the complete AI-Robot Brain system for humanoid robot autonomy
