## Summary of Changes

This specification defines Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics project, focusing on digital twins using Gazebo and Unity. The specification covers physics simulation, high-fidelity visual environments, and sensor simulation for humanoid robots.

## Key Components

- User Story 1: Physics Simulation with Gazebo (P1 priority)
- User Story 2: High-Fidelity Environments with Unity (P2 priority)
- User Story 3: Sensor Simulation (P3 priority)

## Requirements Overview

The specification includes 12 functional requirements covering physics simulation, visual rendering, sensor simulation, and integration with ROS. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic.

## Next Steps

The specification is complete and ready for the planning phase (/sp.plan).
