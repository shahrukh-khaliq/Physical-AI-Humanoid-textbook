## Summary of Changes

This planning document defines the implementation approach for Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics project, focusing on digital twins using Gazebo and Unity. The plan covers the technical architecture and implementation approach.

## Key Components

- Implementation Plan: Technical approach and project structure
- Research: Technology decisions and alternatives evaluated
- Data Model: Conceptual entities and relationships
- Quickstart: Setup and configuration guide
- Contracts: Interface definitions between components

## Implementation Approach

The plan defines a documentation-focused approach using Docusaurus to create educational content about digital twin technology for humanoid robotics, with three main chapters covering Gazebo physics simulation, Unity visual rendering, and sensor simulation.

## Next Steps

The planning phase is complete and ready for task generation (/sp.tasks).
